Beyond my role, I'm an enthusiast of the intricate world of embedded systems, finding joy in the whispers of Raspberry Pis and the choreography of Arduino circuits. They are my canvas and code, my paint. 🚀🤖

My pursuit of knowledge doesn't stop there; I'm captivated by the vast potential of cloud computing and have a special fondness for the innovations within Azure. It's like piecing together a puzzle of the future, one service at a time! ☁️🧩

I'm also navigating the path of personal growth and resilience, guided by my experiences with CPTSD. This journey has transformed me into a vocal advocate for mental health, committed to fostering hope and understanding. 🌟💚

A voracious reader, I delve into the realms of self-help and personal development, always eager to share the wisdom gleaned with others. 📚🌱

I'm passionate about embedded systems, finding joy in tinkering with Raspberry Pis and Arduino circuits. 🚀🤖 Cloud computing, especially within Azure, fascinates me as I piece together the future, one service at a time! ☁️🧩

On a personal note, I'm navigating the journey of resilience with CPTSD, advocating for mental health and fostering hope. 🌟💚 I love reading self-help and personal development books and sharing my learnings with others. 📚🌱

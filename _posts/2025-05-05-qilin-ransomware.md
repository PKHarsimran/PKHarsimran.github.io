You're sipping your morning coffee, casually scanning your dashboards. Then something strange catches your eye ‚Äî unfamiliar file extensions, odd filenames.
A few virtual machines suddenly go dark. Moments later, a message pops up in your inbox: a ransom note.
No, this isn't a Netflix plot. This is ransomware ‚Äî and not just any strain. We're talking about Qilin, also known as Agenda.
In this blog, I‚Äôll guide you through a detailed hypothetical attack scenario rooted in real-world tactics used by this ransomware group. We'll explore how these attacks unfold, highlight common weaknesses that threat actors exploit, and provide clear actions you can take to strengthen your defenses.
This isn‚Äôt fear-mongering. It‚Äôs preparation ‚Äî the kind every organization should take seriously.

> **As of now, Qilin has publicly claimed responsibility for over 437 victims ‚Äî and counting**

## ‚úÖ 2. What Is Qilin / Agenda Ransomware?

### üß¨ Overview

Qilin, formerly known as **Agenda**, is a sophisticated ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation active since mid-2022. Written in both **Go** and **Rust**, it supports attacks against Windows, Linux, and VMware ESXi systems. Its modular payloads and customization capabilities make it a favorite among affiliates targeting high-value sectors.

Qilin attacks are highly tailored ‚Äî operators often fine-tune each payload to bypass detection, avoid encrypting critical system files, and operate during off-hours to maximize impact.

---

### üé≠ Aliases & Evolution

- **Agenda** ‚Äì Initial name used when the ransomware was first reported.
- **Qilin** ‚Äì Rebranded version with enhanced capabilities and evasive tactics.

The rebrand marked a strategic shift with improvements in payload delivery, stronger obfuscation, and Chrome credential theft behavior observed in newer variants.

---

### üåç Industries Targeted

Qilin has impacted over **437 confirmed victims**, particularly targeting sectors with high uptime requirements or sensitive data:

- üè• **Healthcare**
- üßæ **Legal and Professional Services**
- üè´ **Education**
- üè≠ **Manufacturing**
- ‚òÅÔ∏è **Cloud/VPS Hosting Providers**

These industries are typically vulnerable due to outdated infrastructure, lack of segmentation, or slow patching practices.

---

### üí£ Double Extortion Strategy

Qilin combines two major tactics to pressure victims:

1. **Encryption** ‚Äì Files are encrypted using AES-256 and protected by RSA-2048 keys.
2. **Data Theft** ‚Äì Sensitive files are exfiltrated and later leaked on their dark web portal if ransom demands are not met.

Victims often receive ransom notes such as `README.txt` or `qilin_readme.txt`, which contain a Tor link to the negotiation portal and a unique victim ID.

> As of the latest reports, Qilin has exposed over **30 organizations** via public leak sites.

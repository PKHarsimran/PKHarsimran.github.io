> **TL;DR (1 minute read)**  
> Qilin—formerly **Agenda**—is a cross‑platform ransomware‑as‑a‑service (RaaS) first spotted in **July 2022** and written in **Go & Rust**.[^2]  
> *Why you care:* attackers encrypt **and** leak data (*double extortion*), and they’ve already listed **437 victims** on their public leak site.[^1]  
> What follows: a simple attack timeline, plain‑English definitions, indicators of compromise, and **seven quick defenses** any team—small business to enterprise—can apply today.

## 1 — Why You Should Care

Picture this: you’re half‑way through your morning coffee when files on the shared drive sprout strange new extensions. Minutes later an email arrives demanding millions in crypto.  
That’s not Hollywood; that’s the Tuesday many organisations have already lived through courtesy of **Qilin**. As of **May 2025** the gang boasts **437 public victims and counting** on its leak blog.[^1]

## 2 — Qilin in Plain English

| **Fast Fact** | **What it means (no jargon)** | **Source** |
|---------------|--------------------------------|------------|
| First seen July 2022 | The malware has been active almost three years. | [^2] |
| Written in Go & Rust | One code base hits Windows, Linux & ESXi servers alike. | [^2] |
| Business model: RaaS | Core developers rent the malware; *affiliates* run attacks and keep ~ 85 % of each ransom. | [^2][^5] |
| Plays “double extortion” | Files encrypted **and** stolen data published if you refuse to pay. | [^3] |
| Favourite targets | Healthcare, Legal, Education, Manufacturing, Cloud/VPS hosting. | [^3][^6] |

### 2.1 How “Double‑Extortion” Works  
1. **Lock‑up** – Qilin encrypts your data with AES‑256 and hides the key behind RSA‑2048.  
2. **Leak‑threat** – While encrypting, it quietly uploads copies of HR files, contracts, and IP.  
3. **Leverage** – Pay or watch sensitive data go live on their .onion site.

## 3 — MITRE ATT&CK Snapshot (Tech in 30 seconds)

| Stage (fancy term) | Ordinary‑language example | ATT&CK ID |
|---------------------|---------------------------|-----------|
| **Initial Access** | Phishing email or hacking an unpatched VPN | T1566 / T1190 |
| **Execution** | PowerShell script kicks off the payload | T1059 |
| **Persistence** | Adds a task that runs at every reboot | T1053 |
| **Privilege Boost** | Uses a vulnerable driver to become SYSTEM | T1548 |
| **Defense Evasion** | Turns off the antivirus | T1562 |
| **Credential Theft** | Dumps passwords from memory & Chrome | T1003 / T1555[^4] |
| **Lateral Move** | Pushes itself to file servers with PsExec | T1021 |
| **Impact** | Renames files to .qilin and shows ransom note | T1486 |

*(If these IDs look alien, think of ATT&CK as a giant index of hacker tactics.)*

## 4 — Quick‑Reference IOCs

| **Type** | **Value** | **Why it matters** |
|----------|-----------|--------------------|
| SHA‑256 | `aeddd8240c09777a84bb24b5be98e9f5465dc7638bec41fb67bbc209c3960ae1` | Hash of a common Windows payload[^5] |
| Files | `upd.exe`, `main.exe`, `web.dat`, `TPwSav.sys`, `avupdate.dll` | Frequent Qilin components[^5] |
| Onion leak site | `qilinxxc4zxthxse46tmrjppn6s2p7vnmw4nclsbxugrgfcgqz2wx4id.onion` | Where stolen data appears[^6] |

*Tip: Test these safely in a sandbox or threat‑intel portal before blocking in production.*

## 5 — An Attack in Six Simple Steps

1. **Hook** – A staffer clicks a fake invoice; macro spawns a back‑door.  
2. **Foothold** – Malware installs itself as a Windows service (`sc.exe`).  
3. **Map & Spread** – Built‑in tools like `net.exe` and Nmap scan the network.  
4. **Privilege Escalation** – A signed but vulnerable driver (BYOVD) flips the “admin” switch.  
5. **Data Theft** – Archives sensitive shares to a remote server via Rclone or WinSCP.[^5]  
6. **Detonation** – Off‑hours, a scheduled task launches the encryptor; ransom note drops.

## 6 — Seven Fast Defenses (Zero Budget Required)

| **Do this** | **What it looks like** | **Why it works** |
|-------------|------------------------|------------------|
| 1. Turn on MFA everywhere | SMS, authenticator app or FIDO keys for VPN & RDP logins | Stops 90 % of credential‑stuffing attacks[^3] |
| 2. Rotate & limit local‑admin creds | Use Microsoft LAPS or similar | Single device pop ≠ full domain | 
| 3. Patch internet‑facing gear quickly | Prioritise firewalls, hyper‑visors, RMM tools | Qilin loves old Citrix, Fortinet, VMware bugs[^2][^5] |
| 4. Segment the network | Backups, dev, prod on different VLANs with ACLs | Limits blast radius |
| 5. Keep **immutable/offline** backups | Cloud immutability flag or offline disk | Attackers can’t encrypt what they can’t reach |
| 6. Alert on key behaviors | New services, weird PowerShell, mass file renames | Catches midsize incidents early |
| 7. Agree on *Plan B* comms | Printed phone list + Signal/WhatsApp group | Slack/Teams may be down during an attack |

---

## 7 — What Breaks First (Real Incidents)

| **Weak link** | **What happened** | **Fix** |
|---------------|-------------------|---------|
| Shared admin passwords | One laptop compromise = domain takeover | Unique, randomised creds with LAPS |
| Flat network | Encryption blitzed prod **and** backups | VLANs + firewall rules |
| “We have backups!” – on same AD | Backups encrypted, restore impossible | Isolate backup servers & use separate creds |
| No out‑of‑band comms | Teams offline, chaos in email | Pre‑stage Signal/WhatsApp channels |

## 8 — Tools Qilin Uses (Hunt Checklist)

*Data pulled from the open‑source **Ransomware Tool Matrix**.[^7]*

| **Category** | **Examples** | **What to log** |
|--------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Discovery | Nmap, Nping | Any scan from non‑admin hosts |
| Remote Mgmt (RMM) | ScreenConnect, AnyDesk | New installs outside IT group |
| Defense Evasion | PCHunter, YDArk, Zemana ARK | Driver loads in EDR logs |
| Credential Theft | Mimikatz, ChromePass | LSASS dump events |
| Living‑off‑the‑Land | `fsutil`, `wmic`, `psexec` | CMD/PowerShell lines with these tools |
| Exfiltration | Rclone, WinSCP, EasyUpload.io | Large outbound transfers |

## 10 — Final Word

You *don’t* need perfect cybersecurity; you *do* need repeatable basics, clear roles, and a calm team. Nail those, and groups like Qilin will look for softer targets.

*If this helped, share it with someone who keeps postponing that MFA rollout. Stay sharp 👊.*

## 1 — Why You Should Care

You're sipping your morning coffee, casually scanning your dashboards. Then something strange catches your eye — unfamiliar file extensions, odd filenames.
A few virtual machines suddenly go dark. Moments later, a message pops up in your inbox: a ransom note.
No, this isn't a Netflix plot. This is ransomware — and not just any strain. We're talking about **Qilin**, also known as **Agenda**.
In this blog, I’ll guide you through a detailed hypothetical attack scenario rooted in real-world tactics used by this ransomware group. We'll explore how these attacks unfold, highlight common weaknesses that threat actors exploit, and provide clear actions you can take to strengthen your defenses.
This isn’t fear-mongering. It’s preparation — the kind every organization should take seriously.

> As of now, Qilin has publicly claimed responsibility for over **437 victims**, and that number is still growing — according to [ransomware.live](https://www.ransomware.live/group/qilin).

### 🧬 What Is Qilin (aka Agenda) Ransomware?

Qilin, previously tracked as **Agenda**, is a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation that surfaced in mid-2022. It is written in both Go and Rust, and is capable of targeting both Windows and Linux systems — including VMware ESXi.

Victims are often hit with highly customized payloads — operators configure what files to skip, services to disable, and when encryption should trigger.

The group later rebranded from Agenda to Qilin, evolving its tooling, improving detection evasion, and expanding affiliate adoption.

#### Targeted Industries:
- Healthcare
- Education
- Manufacturing
- Legal and Professional Services
- Cloud and Hosting Providers

#### Double Extortion Tactics:
1. **Data Encryption** – Files are encrypted using AES-256 and RSA-2048.
2. **Data Exfiltration** – Stolen data is used for leverage via public leaks if ransom is not paid.

### 2.1 Evolution

- **Agenda** → initial branding  
- **Qilin** → rebrand featuring stronger obfuscation, Chrome credential theft, and BYOVD drivers

### 2.2 How Double Extortion Works

1. **Encryption** — Files are locked with AES‑256, keys protected by RSA‑2048.  
2. **Data theft** — Sensitive documents are exfiltrated during the breach.  
3. **Leverage** — Refuse to pay and the data is published on the leak portal.

## 3 — MITRE ATT&CK Snapshot

### 🔍 MITRE ATT&CK Techniques and Real-World Examples

**Initial Access**
- Techniques: T1078 (Valid Accounts), T1190 (Exploit Public-Facing Apps)
- Example: Qilin affiliates have used stolen RDP credentials and malicious phishing lures with trojanized tools like RVTools.
- Source: [SentinelOne](https://www.sentinelone.com/anthology/agenda-qilin/)

**Execution**
- Techniques: T1059 (Command & Scripting Interpreter)
- Example: Malicious PowerShell one-liners used to download payloads silently.
- Source: [Sophos](https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2024/08/22/qilin-ransomware-caught-stealing-credentials-stored-in-google-chrome/)

**Persistence**
- Techniques: T1053 (Scheduled Task/Job)
- Example: Qilin uses scheduled tasks to relaunch its binary post-reboot.

**Privilege Escalation**
- Techniques: T1548 (Abuse Elevation Control)
- Example: Uses BYOVD (Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver) tactics to disable AV/EDR.

**Defense Evasion**
- Techniques: T1562 (Impair Defenses)
- Example: PowerTool, Zemana AntiRootkit drivers, Carbon Black updaters renamed to `upd.exe`.

**Credential Access**
- Techniques: T1003 (OS Credential Dumping)
- Example: Mimikatz, LSASS memory dumping, and Chrome credential exfiltration.

**Lateral Movement**
- Techniques: T1021 (Remote Services)
- Example: RDP and SMB abuse, using PsExec or stolen creds to pivot internally.

**Impact**
- Techniques: T1486 (Data Encrypted for Impact)
- Example: Silent encryption using Qilin ransomware with extensions like `.qilin` or `.qln`.

*If the IDs look cryptic, ATT&CK is just a public catalogue of hacker techniques.*

### 🚨 Hypothetical Attack Walkthrough

It starts small — a phishing email, a shared credential, or an exposed RDP port.

Qilin gains access and establishes persistence. Tools like PowerShell and WMI help them blend in. You might miss the early signs:
- Service creation with unknown binaries
- Credential stuffing across VPN or Citrix
- Sudden increase in PowerShell execution logs

Eventually, encryption is launched — silently, overnight — targeting shared drives, backups, and endpoints. When your users log in the next day, they’re met with ransom notes and unreadable files.

---

### 🧠 Lessons Learned

**Credential Hygiene**
- Shared admin accounts still exist across machines
- No MFA on remote portals = recipe for breach

**Network Design**
- Flat networks = lateral movement playground

**Backup Safety**
- No isolation = encrypted backups

**Comms Plan**
- Teams default to Slack, WhatsApp — no fallback if infra is down

**Decision Paralysis**
- Who shuts down systems? Who notifies legal? No one’s sure

## 4 — Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)

| **Type** | **Value** | **Why it matters** |
|----------|-----------|--------------------|
| SHA‑256 | `aeddd8240c09777a84bb24b5be98e9f5465dc7638bec41fb67bbc209c3960ae1` | Hash for a common Windows encryptor[^5] |
| Files | `upd.exe`, `main.exe`, `web.dat`, `TPwSav.sys`, `avupdate.dll` | Recurring payload components[^5] |
| Leak site | `qilinxxc4zxthxse46tmrjppn6s2p7vnmw4nclsbxugrgfcgqz2wx4id.onion` | Where stolen data is posted[^6] |

*Always test in a sandbox before blocking in production.*

### 🧼 Cyber Hygiene Tips That Actually Work

- Use **MFA** on everything you can — especially remote access
- Limit **admin rights** and clean up stale accounts
- Patch **internet-facing systems** quickly
- Segment **critical assets** from everyday users
- Store **at least one backup copy offline** — and test recovery
- Set up **alerts** for service creation, file rename bursts, and odd login patterns
- Define **offline comms and response plans** in advance

---

### ✅ What Helped Most

- Quick isolation of infected hosts, even manually, slowed spread
- Visibility from tools like Defender, CrowdStrike, and Splunk helped trace lateral movement
- Out-of-band comms (Signal, SMS, even Zoom) helped keep coordination alive
- Having a printed or static IR checklist meant fewer delays

### 🎯 Final Thoughts

You don’t need perfect. You need **ready**.

Qilin isn’t unique in how it attacks — but in how well it exposes your gaps. The lesson?

> You don’t rise to the level of your plan. You fall to the level of your training.

Run a tabletop. Review your backups. Update your response tree.

You’ve got time now. Use it.

**Stay safe. Stay ready.**

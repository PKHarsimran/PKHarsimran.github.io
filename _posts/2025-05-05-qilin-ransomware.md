## 1 — Why You Should Care
You’re scrolling through dashboards, half‑mug of coffee in hand, when unfamiliar file extensions start blinking. Minutes later a Tor‑link ransom note lands in your inbox.

This isn’t Netflix drama — it’s the working day for 400‑plus organisations hit by **Qilin** since mid‑2022. Let’s make sure you don’t become number 438.

> **Live tally:** Qilin lists **437 victims** on its leak site as of May 2025.

## 2 — Qilin / Agenda at a Glance

| | Key Facts |
|---|---|
| **First Seen** | July 2022 |
| **Languages** | Go (Windows), Rust (Linux/ESXi) |
| **Business Model** | Ransomware‑as‑a‑Service (RaaS) |
| **Favoured Targets** | Healthcare, Legal, Education, Manufacturing, Cloud/VPS |

### 2.1 Evolution
- **Agenda** → initial name.  
- **Qilin** → rebrand with stronger obfuscation, Chrome credential theft, and BYOVD drivers.

### 2.2 Double‑Extortion Playbook
1. **Encrypt** with AES‑256 / RSA‑2048  
2. **Exfiltrate** data; leak if unpaid (`README.txt`, `qilin_readme.txt`)

## 3 — ATT&CK Snapshot

| Tactic | Highlight Techniques |
|---|---|
| Initial Access | T1190 Exploit Public‑Facing App • T1078 Valid Accounts |
| Exec / Persist | T1059 PowerShell • T1053 Scheduled Task |
| Priv Esc / Defense Evasion | T1548 Token Manip • T1562 Disable Security |
| Lateral Move | T1021 Remote Services (RDP/SMB) |
| Impact | T1486 Encryption for Impact |

## 4 — Quick‑Reference IOCs

| Type | Value |
|---|---|
| SHA‑256 | `aeddd8240c09777a84bb24b5be98e9f5465dc7638bec41fb67bbc209c3960ae1` |
| File | `upd.exe`, `main.exe`, `web.dat`, `TPwSav.sys`, `avupdate.dll` |
| Onion | `qilinxxc4zxthxse46tmrjppn6s2p7vnmw4nclsbxugrgfcgqz2wx4id.onion` |

Validate in sandboxes before blocking in prod.

## 5 — How the Attack Unfolds (Condensed Play‑by‑Play)

1. **Initial Foothold** – Phish attachment or exposed RDP.  
2. **Establish Presence** – Service install via `sc.exe`; C2 beacon.  
3. **Privilege Escalation** – BYOVD driver, token theft.  
4. **Lateral Movement** – PsExec / SMB to file servers.  
5. **Staging & Exfil** – Zip sensitive shares to off‑site.  
6. **Trigger Encryption** – Off‑hours task; note drops.  

---

## 6 — Seven Fast Defenses (Steal‑This Checklist)

1. **MFA Everywhere** – VPN, RDP, admin portals.  
2. **Ruthless Privilege Review** – Rotate local‑admin creds; shrink service accounts.  
3. **Patch Internet‑Facing Gear First** – VPNs, hypervisors, RMM.  
4. **Network Segmentation** – Backups & prod on different VLANs plus ACLs.  
5. **Immutable / Offline Backups** – Test restore quarterly.  
6. **EDR Alerting for Known Tactics** – Service creation, odd PowerShell, after‑hours file renames.  
7. **Out‑of‑Band Comms Plan** – Hard‑copy contact list + Signal/WhatsApp fallback.

> **Tip:** Print this list and stick it on your IR room wall. Simplicity wins when panic hits.

## 7 — What Breaks (and How to Fix It)

| Weak Spot | Reality Check | Quick Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Shared local‑admin creds | One host pop = domain‑wide access | LAPS / randomised passwords |
| Flat network | Ransomware spreads at Layer 2 speed | VLAN & firewall micro‑segmentation |
| Backups on the same domain | Attackers encrypt them too | Offline copy + separate creds |
| No comms plan | Slack down = chaos | Agree on alt channel now |

## 8 — Defender Wins to Repeat

- **Aggressive Isolation** – Quarantine first, ask later.  
- **Bare‑Bones Playbook** – Even a 1‑page SOP beats tribal knowledge.  
- **Tabletop Drills** – 30 min every quarter keeps roles clear under stress.

## 9 — Further Reading

- SentinelOne deep‑dive, HHS Threat Profile, SOCRadar intel, Blackpoint PDF.

## 10 — Final Word
You don’t need perfect security—just enough friction to make Qilin look elsewhere. Practise your plan, back up like you mean it, and keep that coffee hot.

*If this helped, pass it on. The next victim might be reading your share.*

## 1 — Why You Should Care

You’re halfway through your morning coffee when files on the shared drive sprout odd extensions. Minutes later an email demands millions in crypto.  
That’s not Netflix drama—it’s a Tuesday many teams have already faced thanks to **Qilin**. The gang publishes each victim on a public Tor site, and the list now tops **437 names**.[^1]

## 2 — Qilin / Agenda at a Glance

| **Quick Fact** | **Plain‑English Meaning** | **Source** |
|----------------|---------------------------|------------|
| **First spotted:** July 2022 | Active nearly three years | [^2] |
| **Languages:** Go (Windows) & Rust (Linux/ESXi) | One codebase, three operating systems | [^2] |
| **Model:** Ransomware‑as‑a‑Service | Core developers rent the malware to affiliates | [^2][^5] |
| **Tactic:** Double extortion | Encrypt + leak victims’ data to force payment | [^3] |
| **Top targets:** Healthcare, Legal, Education, Manufacturing, Cloud/VPS | Industries with uptime pressure or sensitive data | [^3][^6] |

### 2.1 Evolution

- **Agenda** → initial branding  
- **Qilin** → rebrand featuring stronger obfuscation, Chrome credential theft, and BYOVD drivers

### 2.2 How Double Extortion Works

1. **Encryption** — Files are locked with AES‑256, keys protected by RSA‑2048.  
2. **Data theft** — Sensitive documents are exfiltrated during the breach.  
3. **Leverage** — Refuse to pay and the data is published on the leak portal.

## 3 — MITRE ATT&CK Snapshot

| **Stage** | **Real‑World Example** | **ID** |
|-----------|------------------------|--------|
| Initial Access | Phishing or VPN exploit | T1566 / T1190 |
| Execution | PowerShell runs payload | T1059 |
| Persistence | Scheduled task at reboot | T1053 |
| Privilege Escalation | Vulnerable driver (BYOVD) to SYSTEM | T1548 |
| Defense Evasion | Disables antivirus and logs | T1562 |
| Credential Theft | Dumps LSASS & Chrome passwords | T1003 / T1555[^4] |
| Lateral Movement | PsExec to file servers | T1021 |
| Impact | Files renamed *.qilin*; ransom note drops | T1486 |

*If the IDs look cryptic, ATT&CK is just a public catalogue of hacker techniques.*

## 4 — Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)

| **Type** | **Value** | **Why it matters** |
|----------|-----------|--------------------|
| SHA‑256 | `aeddd8240c09777a84bb24b5be98e9f5465dc7638bec41fb67bbc209c3960ae1` | Hash for a common Windows encryptor[^5] |
| Files | `upd.exe`, `main.exe`, `web.dat`, `TPwSav.sys`, `avupdate.dll` | Recurring payload components[^5] |
| Leak site | `qilinxxc4zxthxse46tmrjppn6s2p7vnmw4nclsbxugrgfcgqz2wx4id.onion` | Where stolen data is posted[^6] |

*Always test in a sandbox before blocking in production.*

## 5 —  How a Qilin Attack Unfolds (6 Steps)

1. **Hook** — User opens a phishing invoice; macro launches a downloader.  
2. **Foothold** — Downloader installs itself as a Windows service (`sc.exe`).  
3. **Mapping** — Tools like `net.exe`, Nmap enumerate the network.  
4. **Privilege Escalation** — A signed but vulnerable driver flips the admin switch.  
5. **Data Theft** — Sensitive shares zipped and sent out via Rclone or WinSCP.[^5]  
6. **Detonation** — During off‑hours, a scheduled task launches the encryptor.

## 6 — Seven Fast Defenses

| **Action** | **Real‑World Impact** |
|------------|-----------------------|
| **1. Enforce MFA** on VPN, RDP, admin portals | Blocks most credential stuffing[^3] |
| **2. Rotate & limit local‑admin creds** (LAPS) | Single host compromise ≠ domain takeover |
| **3. Patch internet‑facing gear first** | Qilin loves old Fortinet, Citrix, VMware bugs[^2][^5] |
| **4. Segment the network** (VLAN + ACL) | Containment if one segment is hit |
| **5. Keep immutable/offline backups** | Attackers can’t encrypt what they can’t reach |
| **6. Alert on key behaviors** | New services, weird PowerShell, mass renames |
| **7. Out‑of‑band comms plan** | Printed contacts + Signal/WhatsApp if Slack dies |

## 7 — What Breaks First (Lessons from Real Incidents)

| **Weak link** | **Observed Failure** | **Quick Fix** |
|---------------|----------------------|---------------|
| Shared admin passwords | One laptop pop → domain owned | Unique, random creds via LAPS |
| Flat network | Encryption blitzes prod **and** backups | VLANs + firewall rules |
| “Backups on same domain” | Backups encrypted, no restore | Isolate backup servers, separate creds |
| No alt comms | Teams offline, chaos in email | Pre‑stage Signal/WhatsApp groups |

## 8 — Tools Qilin Likes (Hunt List)

*From the open‑source **Ransomware Tool Matrix**.[^7]*

| **Category** | **Examples** | **What to watch for** |
|--------------|--------------|-----------------------|
| Discovery | Nmap, Nping | Scans from non‑admin hosts |
| RMM abuse | ScreenConnect, AnyDesk | New installs outside IT |
| Defense evasion | PCHunter, YDArk | Driver loads in EDR |
| Credential theft | Mimikatz, ChromePass | LSASS dump alerts |
| Living off the Land | `fsutil`, `psexec` | Suspicious command lines |
| Exfiltration | Rclone, WinSCP | Large outbound transfers |

## 10 — Final Word

You don’t need perfect cybersecurity—just repeatable basics, clear roles, and a calm team. Nail those and Qilin will go looking for softer targets.

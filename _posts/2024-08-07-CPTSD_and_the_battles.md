**Introduction**

Life is a journey filled with unexpected twists and turns. Sometimes, these challenges test our strength and resilience in ways we could never anticipate. My story is one of discovering and managing Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (CPTSD) while navigating a significant career change. It's a tale of struggle, self-discovery, and ultimately, renewal. I hope my journey can inspire others facing similar obstacles.

**Understanding CPTSD: The Dark Clouds**

Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, or CPTSD, is a condition that arises from prolonged trauma, often during childhood. Unlike PTSD, which is usually tied to a single event, CPTSD is rooted in ongoing exposure to trauma. For me, this trauma stemmed from a turbulent environment at home. As a kid, I always had a turbulent environment at home. It was always random: what drama are we handling today? Who is getting beaten today for making a mistake or for no reason? As a kid, I thought this is how some families are, and maybe mine is not that bad. But as I grew up, working with my therapist made me realize how hard I had to survive in the family to keep myself happy—or was it to keep my parents happy by being less of a burden to them or being less of a kid? The symptoms were overwhelming: anxiety, flashbacks, emotional numbness, and a constant state of hyper-vigilance. These symptoms infiltrated every aspect of my life, making even the simplest tasks seem insurmountable.

**The Turning Point: Acknowledging CPTSD**

Acknowledging the presence of CPTSD was the first step towards healing. It wasn’t an easy journey. It took countless hours of therapy, support from loved ones, and immense inner strength to confront the trauma and its effects. Understanding that my struggles were valid and that healing was possible gave me a new perspective on life.

**Navigating Career Change: Embracing Cybersecurity**

As if managing CPTSD wasn't challenging enough, I also found myself at a crossroads in my career. After years in a field that no longer fulfilled me, I realized I needed a change. This was a daunting prospect. Leaving the familiar for the unknown required courage and determination, but I knew it was necessary for my well-being.

**Embracing a New Path in Cybersecurity**

I took a leap of faith and transitioned into cybersecurity, a field that had always intrigued me. With a background in IT and extensive experience in various roles, including as a Security Operations Center Analyst at Columba System Inc and a Cyber Security Analyst at SecureOps, I had a solid foundation to build upon. The learning curve was steep, and there were moments of doubt. However, with each step forward, I found a renewed sense of purpose and passion. My previous struggles had endowed me with a unique perspective and resilience that proved invaluable in my new career.

**Persistence and Skill Development**

The journey was not without its setbacks. There were days when the weight of CPTSD seemed too heavy to bear, and moments when the career shift felt like an insurmountable challenge. However, persistence and a supportive network helped me push through the tough times. My technical skills, including proficiency in programming languages like C++ and Python, and my ability to script in Shell and Bash, played a crucial role in my success. Each small victory reinforced my belief that change, while difficult, is possible and often necessary for growth.

**A New Beginning in Cybersecurity**

Today, I stand stronger and more resilient, having transformed my life in ways I once thought impossible. My journey with CPTSD continues, but I now face it with greater understanding and tools for management. My career in cybersecurity has opened doors I never imagined, allowing me to thrive in a field that excites and challenges me. Completing a Cyber Security certificate from the University of Toronto CE, a Bachelor of Engineering in Technology from Cape Breton University, and an Electromechanical Engineering – Advanced Diploma from Humber College further solidified my expertise and confidence in this new path.

**A Message of Pride and Strength**

To anyone who is working on themselves, especially on those days when the emptiness inside feels overwhelming and the despair seems too strong, I want you to know that I am incredibly proud of you. It takes immense courage to face those dark moments and continue striving for a better life. Remember, you are very strong. Your efforts, even on the hardest days, are a testament to your resilience and determination. Keep pushing forward, because you are capable of incredible things.

**Conclusion: Embrace Your Journey**

If you are struggling with similar challenges, know that you are not alone. The path to healing and transformation is not easy, but it is possible. Embrace your journey, seek support, and believe in your capacity to overcome. Change may be daunting, but it often leads to incredible growth and renewal.

Remember, it’s never too late to start anew. Your past does not define you, but it can empower you to build a brighter, more resilient future.

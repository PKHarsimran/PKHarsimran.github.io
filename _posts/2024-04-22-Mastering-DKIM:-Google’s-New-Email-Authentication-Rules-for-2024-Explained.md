### Introduction

Google is making some important changes to how emails should be sent to Gmail users starting February 1, 2024. These new rules require that senders use specific methods to verify their emails. This helps reduce spam and make sure the emails you receive are genuine and safe.

### What is DKIM?

DKIM, or DomainKeys Identified Mail, is a way to check if an email is truly from the person or organization it claims to be from. It adds a digital signature to the email, like a seal of authenticity, which can be verified by the recipient’s email server.

### Why is Google Implementing These Changes?

Google’s new requirements are designed to:
- **Prevent Fake Emails**: Ensure emails come from real sources, reducing the risk of scams.
- **Improve Delivery**: Verified emails are less likely to end up in the spam folder.
- **Build Trust**: By cutting down on spam and fake emails, users can trust their inbox more.

### Key Changes and Requirements

Starting February 1, 2024, if you send a lot of emails to Gmail addresses, you need to:
1. **Authenticate Emails**: Use SPF, DKIM, and DMARC to verify your emails.
2. **Keep Spam Low**: Make sure your emails have a low spam complaint rate.
3. **Easy Unsubscribe**: Include a one-click unsubscribe option in promotional emails.

### Email Spam Statistics

To highlight the importance of these changes, here are some key statistics about email spam:
- **Spam Prevalence**: In 2023, 45.6% of all emails worldwide were identified as spam&#8203;``【oaicite:5】``&#8203;&#8203;``【oaicite:4】``&#8203;.
- **Spam by Country**: The United States leads in sending spam emails, with over 8 billion spam emails sent daily&#8203;``【oaicite:3】``&#8203;&#8203;``【oaicite:2】``&#8203;.
- **Spam's Financial Impact**: Email spam costs businesses around $20.5 billion annually due to decreased productivity and technical expenses&#8203;``【oaicite:1】``&#8203;.
- **Phishing and Malware**: Approximately 94% of all malware is delivered via email, making it critical to have strong email security&#8203;``【oaicite:0】``&#8203;.

By following these new rules, organizations can protect their email domains from being used for scams and ensure their communications are safe and trustworthy.

### Conclusion

Google's new email rules for 2024 are a big step towards making email more secure. Using DKIM, along with SPF and DMARC, helps ensure that emails are genuine and trusted. By understanding and applying these protocols, you can protect your email, build trust with your audience, and improve your email deliverability.

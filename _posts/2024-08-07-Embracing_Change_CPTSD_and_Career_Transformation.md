**Introduction**

Life doesn't always unfold the way we expect. Sometimes, we grow up thinking our struggles are normal—until one day, we realize we've been surviving, not living. This is my story: a journey marked by trauma, illness, and loss, but also by healing, growth, and resilience. I want to share what Complex PTSD really is, how it shaped my life, and how I fought my way into a career in cybersecurity despite it all.

**Lupus and the First Signs of Something Deeper**

Since childhood, I struggled with unexplained fevers, body aches, and fatigue. My parents chalked it up to allergies or being a sensitive kid. But those weren’t just allergies—they were undiagnosed lupus flares. It wasn’t until much later in life, through therapy and education, that I realized my autoimmune flares were deeply connected to unprocessed trauma. My body wasn’t just sick—it was signaling something deeper: emotional injury.

**From Pain to Power: My Early Journey**

I was born in a modest home in Northern India. My father’s job required us to move often. Each move meant new schools, new languages, and new kids who didn’t understand me. Wearing a turban as a young Sikh child made me a visible target. The bullying was relentless. I learned to hide my emotions and became numb, thinking that was strength.

When we moved to Canada at 13, I thought things would get better. They didn’t. Racism, isolation, and the pressure to succeed in a new country just added more weight. And the physical symptoms—joint pain, fatigue, digestive issues—got worse. But we didn’t talk about mental health. We didn’t talk about trauma. We just “pushed through.”

**Understanding CPTSD: The Trauma That Stays**

Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (CPTSD) is different from PTSD. It’s not from one moment of trauma—it’s from many. Often, it begins in childhood. It's chronic, it's silent, and it rewires how you see yourself and the world. Kids like me don’t always grow up in war zones—but when love feels conditional, and safety isn’t guaranteed, your body learns to brace for pain, even when it’s not there.

CPTSD isn’t always visible. It shows up as:

- Always being on edge, even in safe spaces.

- Deep shame and low self-worth.

- Struggles with trust and relationships.

- Emotional numbness or intense emotional outbursts.

- Difficulty with boundaries or saying no.

And when this trauma is left untreated, it seeps into everything—your health, your confidence, and your dreams.

**Resilience in Action: My Cybersecurity Journey**

Transitioning to cybersecurity wasn’t originally part of my plan. After earning diplomas in robotics and electronics, I started my career as a control engineer. But curiosity had other ideas. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, I decided to shift paths. Enrolling in the University of Toronto SCS Cybersecurity Boot Camp became a turning point in my life.
Despite failing the CompTIA Security+ exam on my first try, I didn’t give up. I studied harder, earned the certification, and proved to myself that I was more than capable. My independent project—a home automation system—showcased my technical skills and passion for problem-solving. It helped me land my first IT role at Telecom Metric during the height of the pandemic, working virtually as a IT Specialist.

**Facing Personal Loss with Continued Strength**

Soon after completing my boot camp, I faced a devastating loss—my grandfather, the only person who showed me calm and kindness during my chaotic childhood, passed away from cancer. At the same time, I was actively job hunting and trying to escape a toxic environment. The grief felt unbearable, but the resilience I had built over the years gave me the strength to push through and keep growing.

**Healing through Therapy: CBT and EMDR**

Therapy has played an essential role in my healing journey. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) significantly helped me retrain my mind, teaching me to recognize and accept my experiences as genuine abuse, not just instances of people being rude or mean. CPTSD often distorts perceptions, making it difficult to distinguish abuse from everyday rudeness or negativity.
Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy was transformative, enabling me to revisit and process deep-seated grief by connecting with my younger self. EMDR helped me confront emotional wounds I had long suppressed, facilitating profound emotional release and healing.

**Moments of Pride**

My journey has been marked by significant moments of pride and empowerment:
1. **Achieving the CompTIA Security+ Certification:** Even when faced with failures and setbacks, continuing to push forward and not giving up leads to eventual success.
2. **Embracing Independence:** Taking care of oneself, both physically and mentally, is essential for overall well-being and long-term success.
3. **Landing My First Cybersecurity Job:** No matter how challenging the circumstances, it is possible to change one’s path and create a better future.
4. **Inner Strength:** We often underestimate our inner strength. Realizing and embracing this strength can lead to profound personal growth and resilience.

**Key Lessons in Resilienc**

1. **Perseverance Pays Off:** Even when faced with failures and setbacks, continuing to push forward and not giving up leads to eventual success.
2. **Self-Care is Crucial:** Taking care of oneself, both physically and mentally, is essential for overall well-being and long-term success.
3. **Change is Possible:** No matter how challenging the circumstances, it is possible to change one’s path and create a better future.
4. **Inner Strength:** We often underestimate our inner strength. Realizing and embracing this strength can lead to profound personal growth and resilience.

**A Message of Pride and Encouragement**

To those navigating pain, change, or recovery—especially those living with CPTSD—know this: you’re not broken. You are building. And I am incredibly proud of you. Keep showing up for yourself. Every small step matters.

**Conclusion: Your Journey Matters**

Whether you're healing from trauma, reinventing your career, or simply learning to believe in yourself again—this story is proof that it's never too late. Embrace the journey. Honor the process. Trust your strength.
Your past doesn't define your future. It equips you to build one that’s stronger, freer, and entirely your own.

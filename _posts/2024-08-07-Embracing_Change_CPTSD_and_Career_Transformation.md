**Introduction**

Life often surprises us with challenges that push us far beyond our perceived limits. My journey, deeply entwined with Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (CPTSD), is a testament to the strength we discover in adversity. By sharing my story of healing, personal growth, and career transformation, I aim to connect with, support, and inspire others navigating similar hardships—especially those exploring a path in cybersecurity.

**From Pain to Power: My Early Journey**

I was born in Northern India, in a modest two-story home within an industrial town. We were a typical middle-class family—our needs met but dreams modest. My father's job at the Bank of India meant frequent relocations, each transition feeling abrupt and unsettling. Every new school brought with it unfamiliar cultures and languages, heightening my feelings of isolation.
As a young Punjabi Sikh wearing a turban, I stood out, often becoming a target for relentless bullying. Harsh words and cruel nicknames deeply scarred my self-esteem, pain I silently endured due to a lack of support and understanding. With each move, the emotional wounds grew deeper, manifesting in both mental and physical symptoms.
At age 13, relocating to Canada brought a hopeful promise of a fresh start. Yet, racism and cultural insensitivity continued to shadow me. The compounded trauma from years of neglect and bullying culminated in severe emotional and physical symptoms, including struggles with potty training that persisted into my late teens—clear signs of untreated Complex PTSD.

**Understanding CPTSD: The Dark Clouds**

Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, or CPTSD, often feels like living under persistent dark clouds, casting shadows over every aspect of life. Unlike PTSD, which typically arises from a single traumatic event, CPTSD results from prolonged, repeated trauma or neglect, usually beginning in childhood or adolescence. It’s characterized by deep emotional wounds that affect self-esteem, relationships, and overall emotional health.
In my experience, CPTSD manifested as constant anxiety, chronic feelings of worthlessness, emotional numbness, and difficulties trusting others. Day-to-day tasks felt overwhelming, and forming healthy relationships was a challenge. For years, I carried an invisible burden that others couldn't easily understand.
Recognizing and understanding CPTSD was my first crucial step toward recovery. Learning about the condition provided clarity, validating my experiences and emotions. It was the beginning of healing, illuminating pathways toward managing symptoms, rebuilding trust, and ultimately reclaiming control of my life.

**Resilience in Action: My Cybersecurity Journey**

Transitioning to cybersecurity wasn’t originally part of my plan. After earning diplomas in robotics and electronics, I started my career as a control engineer. But curiosity had other ideas. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, I decided to shift paths. Enrolling in the University of Toronto SCS Cybersecurity Boot Camp became a turning point in my life.
Despite failing the CompTIA Security+ exam on my first try, I didn’t give up. I studied harder, earned the certification, and proved to myself that I was more than capable. My independent project—a home automation system—showcased my technical skills and passion for problem-solving. It helped me land my first cybersecurity role at Telecom Metric during the height of the pandemic, working virtually as a SOC Analyst.

**Facing Personal Loss with Continued Strength**

Soon after completing my boot camp, I faced a devastating loss—my grandfather, the only person who showed me calm and kindness during my chaotic childhood, passed away from cancer. At the same time, I was actively job hunting and trying to escape a toxic environment. The grief felt unbearable, but the resilience I had built over the years gave me the strength to push through and keep growing.

**Healing through Therapy: CBT and EMDR**

Therapy has played an essential role in my healing journey. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) significantly helped me retrain my mind, teaching me to recognize and accept my experiences as genuine abuse, not just instances of people being rude or mean. CPTSD often distorts perceptions, making it difficult to distinguish abuse from everyday rudeness or negativity.
Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy was transformative, enabling me to revisit and process deep-seated grief by connecting with my younger self. EMDR helped me confront emotional wounds I had long suppressed, facilitating profound emotional release and healing.

**Moments of Pride**

My journey has been marked by significant moments of pride and empowerment:
1. **Achieving the CompTIA Security+ Certification:** Even when faced with failures and setbacks, continuing to push forward and not giving up leads to eventual success.
2. **Embracing Independence:** Taking care of oneself, both physically and mentally, is essential for overall well-being and long-term success.
3. **Landing My First Cybersecurity Job:** No matter how challenging the circumstances, it is possible to change one’s path and create a better future.
4. **Inner Strength:** We often underestimate our inner strength. Realizing and embracing this strength can lead to profound personal growth and resilience.

**Key Lessons in Resilienc**

1. **Perseverance Pays Off:** Even when faced with failures and setbacks, continuing to push forward and not giving up leads to eventual success.
2. **Self-Care is Crucial:** Taking care of oneself, both physically and mentally, is essential for overall well-being and long-term success.
3. **Change is Possible:** No matter how challenging the circumstances, it is possible to change one’s path and create a better future.
4. **Inner Strength:** We often underestimate our inner strength. Realizing and embracing this strength can lead to profound personal growth and resilience.

**A Message of Pride and Encouragement**

To those navigating pain, change, or recovery—especially those living with CPTSD—know this: you’re not broken. You are building. And I am incredibly proud of you. Keep showing up for yourself. Every small step matters.

**Conclusion: Your Journey Matters**

Whether you're healing from trauma, reinventing your career, or simply learning to believe in yourself again—this story is proof that it's never too late. Embrace the journey. Honor the process. Trust your strength.
Your past doesn't define your future. It equips you to build one that’s stronger, freer, and entirely your own.

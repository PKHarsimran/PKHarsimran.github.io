## Introduction

Imagine waking up to find your business's data locked away by hackers demanding a ransom. Scary, right? Cyber threats like this are a constant concern these days, and keeping your business secure is no longer just a good idea—it’s essential. Whether you’re running a small shop or managing a large company, cyber threats don’t take a day off. Fortunately, you don’t need an enormous budget or a big team to get started. A basic Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) program can go a long way in safeguarding your business.

Think of CTI as your business’s watchdog. It monitors for threats, keeps an eye on potential dangers, and helps you take action before problems escalate. The best part? You can start small and gradually enhance your CTI program as your business grows.

In this blog, I’ll guide you through setting up a straightforward CTI program that’s suited to your business, regardless of its size. I’ll explain what CTI is, how to choose the right tools, and how to involve your team. By the end, you’ll have the foundation to protect your business from cyber threats—and you might even find the process enjoyable.

## Understanding Cyber Threat Intelligence

Before we jump into setting up a Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) program, it's important to get a clear picture of what CTI really is. In simple terms, CTI is like a security camera for your business—it monitors for potential cyber threats, analyzes the data, and helps you take the right actions to protect your assets.

CTI isn’t a one-size-fits-all concept. It’s divided into different types, each serving a unique purpose:

1. **Strategic Intelligence:** This provides a big-picture view of potential threats. It’s all about understanding broader trends and the overall threat landscape. This type of intelligence is particularly useful for making informed decisions at the executive level.

2. **Tactical Intelligence:** Tactical intelligence is more about the here and now. It focuses on identifying immediate threats, such as specific attack methods or vulnerabilities. This type is crucial for your security team to respond quickly and effectively to current risks.

3. **Operational Intelligence:** This type digs deeper into the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by cybercriminals. It helps in understanding how an attack might unfold and what specific steps need to be taken to mitigate it.

4. **Technical Intelligence:** Technical intelligence is all about the nuts and bolts—things like IP addresses, malware signatures, and domain names that are linked to cyber threats. This type of intelligence is vital for your technical teams to defend against specific threats.

By understanding these different types of CTI, you can better tailor your approach to meet the unique needs of your business. The key is to start with the basics and gradually expand your CTI capabilities as your understanding grows.

## Introduction

Imagine waking up to find your business's data locked away by hackers demanding a ransom. Scary, right? Cyber threats like this are a constant concern these days, and keeping your business secure is no longer just a good idea—it’s essential. Whether you’re running a small shop or managing a large company, cyber threats don’t take a day off. Fortunately, you don’t need an enormous budget or a big team to get started. A basic Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) program can go a long way in safeguarding your business.

Think of CTI as your business’s watchdog. It monitors for threats, keeps an eye on potential dangers, and helps you take action before problems escalate. The best part? You can start small and gradually enhance your CTI program as your business grows.

In this blog, I’ll guide you through setting up a straightforward CTI program that’s suited to your business, regardless of its size. I’ll explain what CTI is, how to choose the right tools, and how to involve your team. By the end, you’ll have the foundation to protect your business from cyber threats—and you might even find the process enjoyable.
